        <p>The above picture is of Him. Our Lord and Savior, Sam Conlon.</p>
        <p>When in doubt of our coding skills we ask ourselves, 'What Would Sam Do?'.</p>
        <p>Disclaimer: We understand that this may be confusing for some, and you may be asking yourself, 'If the purpose of this site is to provide coding practice for Him, Sam Conlon, then why would HE be asking HIMSELF for guidance when running into to problems while practicing?' The answer here is simple. At times, He descends back into the mortal Realm to play the part of a simpleton. He does this to better understand his worshippers and we love Him for this sacrifice. While in the mortal Realm, he forgets all He knows of His godliness and thus prays to Himself for guidance. What a simpleton. We hope that this clears up any confusion that our viewers may have, and we hope that you enjoy your visit here. Sam Bless. Amen.</p>
